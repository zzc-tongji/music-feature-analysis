# Music Feature Analysis #

### Introduction ###

This repo is created in April 2016. It is a part of my graduation project (correlation between music features and EEG).  

### Environment ###

* MATLAB R2012a  
* [MIRtoolbox 1.6](https://www.jyu.fi/hum/laitokset/musiikki/en/research/coe/materials/mirtoolbox) (Click [here](https://bitbucket.org/zzc_actual/music-feature-analysis/downloads/MIRtoolbox1.6.zip) to download)  

### Script ###

Script 'zzc_music.m' can be used to extract some features of music, such as:  

* spectral centroid  
* spectral entropy  
* spectral flux  
* key clarity  
* mode  
* fluctuation centroid  
* fluctuation entropy  
* pulse clarity  
* sound intensity  
* power  
* sharpness  

Script 'zzc_pure_tone.m' can be used to generate pure tone of any frequency.  

Script 'zzc_mean_compare.m' can be used to compare the average of each feature in different music.  

### Other ###

* All lines end up with CRLF (Windows).
